Note: You can also find all files for he project here.
Introducition # With this instruction I will show you how to build yourself(bar-) terminals, that use radio signals to send each other predefined messages.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/instruction-bar-terminals/cover-bottom.png"/></item><item><title>Project Second Semester</title><link>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/project-second-semester/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 22:22:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/project-second-semester/</guid><description>Project pitch # We started the second semester with a presentation about the pitch of the project we planned to tackle for the second semester.

The process to a finished print generally starts from an idea and measures which is followed by 3D-modeling, the finished model then gets exported as a mesh, after that sliced to GCode which 3D-printers understand.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/additive-manufacturing/feature.jpg"/></item><item><title>Subtractive Manufacturing</title><link>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/subtractive-manufacturing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 16:48:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/subtractive-manufacturing/</guid><description>In the lecture part of subtractive manufacturing we first learned about vector graphics as well as G-Code which is used in a lot of computer guided machines like laser cutters, 3D-printers, etc.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/subtractive-manufacturing/feature.JPG"/></item><item><title>Mechanics</title><link>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/mechanics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:31:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/mechanics/</guid><description>In the lecture part of mechanics we learnd a little bit about the physical basics and some important formulas regarding them.
