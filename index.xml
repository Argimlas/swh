The process to a finished print generally starts from an idea and measures which is followed by 3D-modeling, the finished model then gets exported as a mesh, after that sliced to GCode which 3D-printers understand.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/additive-manufacturing/feature.jpg"/></item><item><title>Subtractive Manufacturing</title><link>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/subtractive-manufacturing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 16:48:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/subtractive-manufacturing/</guid><description>In the lecture part of subtractive manufacturing we first learned about vector graphics as well as G-Code which is used in a lot of computer guided machines like laser cutters, 3D-printers, etc.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/subtractive-manufacturing/feature.JPG"/></item><item><title>Mechanics</title><link>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/mechanics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:31:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://argimlas.github.io/swh/posts/mechanics/</guid><description>In the lecture part of mechanics we learnd a little bit about the physical basics and some important formulas regarding them.
