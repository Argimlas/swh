I really wanted to write a documentation/building-instructions for my exercise project so here it is!

## Introduction

## Parts and devices you need

I, unfortunately for probably most, use an iPhone so this instruction is for iPhone only, though it should not be a problem or even easier to do this via android.

Now to the Hardware you need:
 - 1 ESP32 as "brain" for everything
 - 1 Servo-Motor (SG90 is enough)
 - 1 geared DC-Motor with shaft on both sides like [this one](https://www.google.com/search?q=dc+getriebemotor+arduino+gelb)
 - 1 Motor shield L298N
 - 2 9V batterys one for the DC-Motor, the other one for the servo and ESP32
 - DC converter to 5V for the servo and ESP32
 - screws & nuts TODO: exact sizes
 - TODO lego tires and stangen (vorne & hinten)

In terms of devices a 3D printer and a laser cutter is necesary to manufacture the parts for the project.

## Manufacturing

For Manufacturing I decided to use 3D printing and laser-cutting.
First of all to learn about both of those production methods and to safe time, because big flat surfaces are faster laser cutted and specific more plastic parts are easier to produce with a 3D-printer.

**Note:** You can also find all files for he project [here](rc-car-argimlas.zip).

### Laser-Cutting

The base of the car as well as the body of the car are 3d printed because I just need big flat surfaces with cutouts to creat them.

#### Base

The base of the car is quite simple and everything gets attached to it.

#### Lower sides of the car

#### Upper part of the car

### 3D Printing

#### Steering axle
