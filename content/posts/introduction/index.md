Hey, I'm Jakob!

I study Media Informatics at Ulm University in my 5th semester (at the time of this post). In my free time I like to do sports, build stuff out of wood and design my own Lego Technic RC-Cars.

By attending this subject I hope to extend my knowledge about microcontrollers and modeling in 3D. Furthermore I'm looking forward to learn how to use a 3D-Printer, CNC and a Laser-Cutter for the first time.

I chose this subject because I'm generally interested building DIY stuff and for school I did a microcontroller-project in which i tried to build a RC-Car with automatic differential-locks. The car worked more or less and with this subject I hope to clear some difficulties I faced in this project.

If I had all the tools and abilitys I need, I would like to build a reciever to start my PC over my phone and a button build Into my desk which turns on my power strip via a relay as well as my PC simultaneously.
All the stuff could be hidden underneath my small shelf on which my screens are standing behind a laser-cutted IO-shield
