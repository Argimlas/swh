In the lecture part of mechanics we learnd a little bit about the physical basics and some important formulas regarding them. We got introduced to levers, pulleys, wheels and axles as well as screws and gears. After that the basic functionality of motors got explained and how a dc-motor transforms electrial energy into a rotation. Servo motors and stepper-motors were presented as well.
In the robotics part we learned about different kinds of linkages and the resulting kinematics out of linkages. In the end we got introduced to the concept of soft robotics inspired by nature and how to unterstand mechanisms.

# **Lab**

In the lab part we then explored some mechanisms with a "Fischertechnik-Baukasten".

## **Push crank**

First we build a push crank, which transforms a rotational motion into a linear motion.

## **Manual gearbox with 3 gears**

After the push crank we had to build a manual gearbox with 3 gears.
