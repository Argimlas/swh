[{"content":"Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Jakob!\nI study Media Informatics at Ulm University in my 5th semester (at the time of this post). In my free time I like to do sports, build stuff out of wood and design my own Lego Technic RC-Cars.\nBy attending this subject I hope to extend my knowledge about microcontrollers and modeling in 3D. Furthermore I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to learn how to use a 3D-Printer, CNC and a Laser-Cutter for the first time.\nI chose this subject because I\u0026rsquo;m generally interested building DIY stuff and for school I did a microcontroller-project in which i tried to build a RC-Car with automatic differential-locks. The car worked more or less and with this subject I hope to clear some difficulties I faced in this project.\nIf I had all the tools and abilitys I need, I would like to build a reciever to start my PC over my phone and a button build Into my desk which turns on my power strip via a relay as well as my PC simultaneously. All the stuff could be hidden underneath my small shelf on which my screens are standing behind a laser-cutted IO-shield\n","date":"5 November 2022","permalink":"/swh/posts/test-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Jakob!\nI study Media Informatics at Ulm University in my 5th semester (at the time of this post).
