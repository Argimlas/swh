[{"content":"This post features the instruction for my bar terminals.\nIntroducition # With this instruction I will show you how to build yourself(bar-) terminals, that use radio signals to send each other predefined messages.\nThe terminal allows you to select a message and send it to a selected ohter terminal and displays recieved messages on an oled. If a message is recieved a LED turns on to indicate a recieved message.\nThe messages are send via a radio signal and the terminals are implemented as a really simplified mesh-network so each terminal recieves the message and if the message is not meant for the terminal it forwards the message. This also allows to bridge longer distances than the radio signal can reach.\nEverything you need # For 3 bar-terminals you need the following:\nParts # 3 x HC-12 radio module: Amazon 3 x Arduino nano: Amazon 3 x 128x64 oled: Amazon 3 x EC12 rotary encoder: Amazon 3 x Red LEDs (5mm) 3 x 100 µF Capacitor 3 x 220 Ω Resistor (for LED - pulldown) 9 x 10 kΩ Resistor (for Rotary encoder - pulldown) Hardware # filament for your 3D-printer Solder (and if needed Flux) Wires shrink tubing hot-glue-sticks 3 x breadboards like those: Amazon 3 x 9V Battery Tools # 3D Printer Soldering Station/Iron If needed: helping hands for soldering or a vise as misused helping hands :D Hot-glue-gun Wire stripper Pliers Saw (Handsaw, Bandsaw or similar) Soldering # In the following image you can see how everything is supposed to be wired up. I always used 70mm long wires for soldering.\nsoldering diagram Because the space is limited you need to cut the breadboards to the desired size of 18x11 holes.\nTo connect more holes I used a short wire and soldered it to each hole and the pin of the arduino.\ncutted breadboard with connection of holes 5V and gnd line from top As you can see I only soldered the pins of the arduino, that I needed. On the left picture on the left hand side you can see the gnd and 5V line from the bottom. The next step would be to connect the gnd-arduino-pin with the gnd line and the 5V pin with the 5V line.\ngnd connection 5V-connection VIN and gnd-wire for the external power source\nblue: VIN-wire, black: gnd-wire Next you should solder the radio-module.\nSolder the 100 µF Capacitor onto the module. ⚠️ be carefull so that the white side of the capacitor is connected to the gnd pin of the radio-module\nNow solder all 4 wires to the radio-module.\nIn the last step you solder the wires from the radio module to your breadboard, start with gnd then 5V and then the two data wires.\nradio-module with capacitor After the radio module continue with soldering the oled-screen. Again, first solder the wires to the screen and then to the breadboard. On the breadboard start with gnd, then 5V, then the data wires.\nNow the LED follows. First solder the 220 Ω Resistor onto the short leg (cutted side) of the LED. This side also goes onto your gnd line on the breadboard. After that solder the other leg of the LED onto the data pin.\nNext is the rotary encoder:\nFirst solder all the wires onto the rotary encoder and then the two gnd wires onto the gnd-line on the breadboard.\nAfter that, solder the three 10 kΩ Resistors onto the 5V-line and then onto the three data pins. To prevent short circuits use shrink tubing around the resistors and only leave a small part of the wire unprotected.\n10 kΩ Resistors with shrink tubing To finish solder the data wires onto the breadboard.\nCongratulations you finished soldering everything! It should look somewhat like this:\nleft front right 3D-printing # Now you need to print the housing of the Termial. It consists of two parts, the box and the cover.\nThe measurements of my box are for a specific cash register we use at our uni-partys, if you want to fit the terminal into your cash register you probably have to take the measurements yourself and design your own box.\nFor printing you dont need support structure!\nbox # cover # //druckdateien\nAssembly # Code # Finished! # //zip\nlicense # https://creativecommons.org/licenses/?lang=de\n","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/swh/posts/instruction-bar-terminals/","section":"Posts","summary":"This post features the instruction for my bar terminals.\nIntroducition # With this instruction I will show you how to build yourself(bar-) terminals, that use radio signals to send each other predefined messages.","title":"Instruction Bar Terminals"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/swh/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"On this site I will document the progress of my DIY-project in the subject \u0026ldquo;Sketching with Hardware\u0026rdquo; at Institute of Media Informatics at Ulm University.\n","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/swh/","section":"Sketching with Hardware","summary":"On this site I will document the progress of my DIY-project in the subject \u0026ldquo;Sketching with Hardware\u0026rdquo; at Institute of Media Informatics at Ulm University.","title":"Sketching with Hardware"},{"content":" Project pitch # We started the second semester with a presentation about the pitch of the project we planned to tackle for the second semester.\nThe Problem I wanted to solve is communication between bars and finances at Uni-Partys.\nCurrently DECTs are used to communicate on uni-partys. DECTs are basically old button cellphones, which allow you to call someone, write messages and thats about it. The main things you want to communicate to others (bars or finances in specific) is to ask for change, that you need helpers or a refill of clean glasses.\nThe Problem with talking over DECTs is that because of the music its hard to understand each other. The number of DECTs we have available is also limited, which results in only two persons per bar actually having a DECT.\nSo my idea was to create small bar-terminals which can be located in all the cashboxes behind bars at uni-partys to communicate between each other.\nThe terminals are supposed to:\nbe scaleable (as many terminals as you want per bar, as many bars as you want) have predefined messages from which the user can select one and send it to a specific selected bar have a button to send messages to finances have a screen to show messages On top of that it also would be nice if the send messages to finances could be shown on a website so that finances can open this site on their laptop to read the messages.\nThe last problem is that the wifi-access-point can be overloaded due to the high amount of people (1500) on a small space. Because of this I decided to use a 433mHz radio signal to communicate between the bars and implement everything as a mesh-network to bridge longer distances between bars.\nTimeline # From the Pitch till the presentation of our project at the \u0026ldquo;Streiflicht\u0026rdquo; at Ulm University we had 7 Weeks (17.05.23 - 05.07.23).\nI set myself the following timeline and milestones:\nFirst two weeks (17.05.23 - 29.05.23):\nResearch on mesh-networks, radio-signals and radio-modules for arduino, because I barely had any knowledge about any of those topics.\nAs soon as my ordered parts would arrive my plan was to put everything together on a breadboard and start programming.\nMilestone 1 till the 11.06.23:\nHave a working system on a breadboard\nAfter that my plan was create a housing with the buttons and solder everything together.\nMilestone 2 till the 25.06.23:\nFirst version of the project is finished and ready to be presented\nTill the 05.07.23:\nImprove small things if necesary\nFirst weeks until the 12.06.23 # Contrary to my timeline I spend more time into research about mesh networks and radio modules. On top of that my order of the radio modules got lost as well, which set me back a little.\nIn my pitch I also got some tips for other ways to communicate between the terminals like using the already existing DECT-Network or LoRaWan, so I reserched about them as well and asked a lecturer for further information.\nAs soon as the two radio modules I orderd arrived, I tested both of them about generall usability and functionality as well as the range of the radio signal:\nThe NRF24L01-module:\nThe older of the two modules need 7 pins to connect to an arduino, uses 2,4 GHz, the range is not that good, theres more documentation in the internet for this one\nHC-12-moduel:\nNewer, needs only 4 pins to connect to an arduino, uses 433 MHz, range was better in my tests and it seemed more intuitive to use for me.\nSo I decided to use radio modules and choose the HC-12 module over the NRF24L01+PA+LNA-module. The main reasons were longer range, fewer pins to connect, which would make soldering a lot easier later and that it seemed more intuitive to use for me.\nI also ordered rotary encoders and oled-displays to use for the view and controll of my terminal.\nUndortunately I did not reached the goal of my first milestone, because I just had decided for a radio module.\n12.06. - 20.06 # In this week I focused on the view and controll of my bar-terminal.\nTo show the user all the necesary Information i used a 128x64 pixel oled. For manipulation of the oled like selecting a message, selecting a bar and sendig it to that bar I used a rotary encoder.\nI researched a lot about menues with rotary encoders and which library to use to create a menue, but everything I could find surpassed my needs and was extremely complex for just a simple menue so I decided to implement a menue myself. A lot of librarys also nearly completely filled the ram of an arduino which was bad if you want to implement more stuffe besides the menue.\nIm pretty proud of the result so I\u0026rsquo;m planning to put it on Instructables or a similar site so other people can use it as well.\nI used the SSD1306Ascii-library made bei greiman which is pretty resourcefull and not overloaded.\n20.06. - 26.06. # In this week I connected my radio modules with the oled and rotary encoder with my menue.\nI basically reached Milestone 1 in this week because I had a finished prototype on a breadboard.\nIt was now possible to select a messages, a bar which is supposed to recieve the message and send the message. The other Terminal then was able to display the Message and from which bar it came.\nWhen a message was send, every other terminal recieved it and decided based on the header, if the message was meant for itself or not.\nIf the message was meant for that terminal it displayed the message, otherwise the message got forwarded.\nThe header was build out of a string containing 3 numbers:\nThe first number indicated which message was send. The second number indicated to which terminal the message was supposed to go. The third number indicated from which terminal the message was send. In this week I also organised the inlay of a cashe register we use at uni-partys to take to measurements of one of the compartments which is supposed to hold the box of my terminal. I also decided to add a LED to the Terminal, which indicates if a message is recieved.\nAfter this week my plan was to finish milesonte 2 but I only soldered one of the three terminals and the housing of the terminals was not yet printed.\n26.06. - 03.07. # In this week I designed the housing of my terminals, made a test print if the housing would fit into the cash-register inlay. I also made a test print for the cover of my housing, to see if my measurements for the led, antenna of the radio-module, oled-screen and rotary encoder would fit.\nI also soldered the other two terminals and mades some improvements in the code.\nweek of presentation until the 05.07.23 # In the last days i finished printing the housings and covers for them. I wanted to print a second revision for the covers, unfortunately the printer stopped working so I had to go with my first version in the presentation.\nStreiflicht on 05.07 # At the Streiflicht the whole SwH group had a romm in which we presented our projects to interested guests. There were also some lectures which were pretty interesting. I really enjoyed the streiflich and the interaction with interest people in my project were good. We discussed about further improvements and the hardware I used for my project.\nConclusion: # I was able to implement the key part of my project, the Terminal and beeing able to communicate between bars.\nUnfortunatly there was not enough time to also add a webpage for finances, so that they can recieve the messages via they\u0026rsquo;re laptop. On the other hand they can also just use a terminal to recieve messages which works fine as well. The idea for the webpage would have been to use a wemos d1 mini microcontroller to recieve radio signals and log into wifi to submit the information to the webpage.\nAnother idea was to build a Button myself by using a compliant mechanism, but I also did not have enough time for that.\nI spontaneously added an LED to show if something was recievedt which is pretty helpful for usability in my opinion.\nTools and methods # Compared to my exercise project this project was more on the sowftware side, than the hardware side. In my opinion that was pretty good because I\u0026rsquo;d day my weakness is more in programming than building stuff.\nFor programming I used visual-studio-code with platform.io, a arduino extention which is way better than the standard arduino IDE. I really enjoyed working with it, because managing librarys is a lot easeier as well as working with more than one arduino (3 terminals) at the same time because you can specify upload ports. Syntax highlighting is another big plus for platform.io.\nTo produce the housing and cover for it I only worked with 3D-printers. In the end one printer stopped working, which was unlucky but other than that I had no problems and really enjoyed working with all the printers in the lab.\nTo attach the LED, oled-screen and radio-module to the cover I used hot glue which didn\u0026rsquo;t cause any problems either. The rotary encoder got attached by the included screw.\nFor soldering I used the soldering-irons in the lab and my soldering-iron at home and the band saw in the lab to cut the breadboards to size. With the tools in the lab I did not have any problems, for the soldering-iron at home of which the temperature can\u0026rsquo;t be adjusted I learned that pointy soldering tips are bad compared to tips with a wide tip because the heat gets ditributed differently.\nMotivation and feedback for future semesters # I think the most of my motivation for the module came through my existing interests in microcontrolles and building stuff (from lego models to the desk for my pc with screen holders and builtin buttons). The lab with all the accessible tools, machines and other usefull stuff was another big motivation, because the posibilities get a lot bigger than with the stuff I have at home. At last our main lecturer and also the other lecturers motivated me because if I had questions or problems they always could help me and in genereally hat a lot of usefull input.\nI think for the future I generally gained a deeper knowledge about working with microcontrollers, 3D-printers, laser cutters and about the posiblities that you have with those tools, also the projects of fellow students helped with getting inspirations for future projects I want to do myself.\nThe two main things I learned thorugh my project for the second semester is that even something that seems impossible, because of missing knowledge about the topic and resulting out of that the inability to assess if you will manage to do the project, that it is still possible. When pitching the project I was very insecure about the possibility of me finishing the project, but in the end it worked and I learned a lot of new interesting stuff about microcontrollers, radio-signals and -modules. For the first time I also understood the basics of Networks which definitely will help me a lot for my further informatic studies.\nIn general I am happy with how the module is structured and I also think the topics we got introduced to were helpfull. The only thing I would recommend for future semsesters would be more time for the main project in the second semester. Maybe pitch the project at the end of the first semester so that you have the whole lecture free time and the summer semester for the project. The last thing I would note is, that it was quiet hard to find a project that solves a problem or is unique beacuse these days almost everything is in the internet and I think maybe just a new approch to an already existing project is also challanging enough, because I spend a lot of time thinking about a real problem I want to solve that isn\u0026rsquo;t already solved.\nFinal Project # Summary of my plan # Functions # //video\nImprovements # ","date":"18 July 2023","permalink":"/swh/posts/project-second-semester/","section":"Posts","summary":"Project pitch # We started the second semester with a presentation about the pitch of the project we planned to tackle for the second semester.\nThe Problem I wanted to solve is communication between bars and finances at Uni-Partys.","title":"Project Second Semester"},{"content":" Presentation # We had a small fair to present our projects. Everyone of us got a small space at a table with our posters behind it to present our project to interested people that were invited.\nEveryone who came to my project was really interested and asked detailed questions about it, which made the overall presentation pretty enjoyable.\nI remember the following questions:\nDid I designed everything (laser-cutted and 3D-printed parts) for the project myself?\nYes I did.\nDid I use bluetooth or wifi to controll the car?\nBluetooth.\nDid I programm the bluetooth app myself?\nNo I did not.\nWhat was the most challenging part of my project?\nDefinitely designing the steering mechanism. It involved a lot of measuring and several tries to print all the interlocking parts.\nWhat the various electronic components in my project are responsible for.\nESP32 development board as a microcontorller Servo for stearing DC-motor for acceleration Two 9V blocks for power Voltage converter to get the 9V down to 5V for the microcontroller Motor driver to controll the DC-motor How many motors did I use?\nTwo (Servo for steering and DC-motor for acceleration).\nIn general the feedback to my project was really positive and with some visitors I talked about further improvements I wanted to add to the car, like lights for example.\nReview of the semester # Looking back over the first semester of sketching with hardware I had a lot of fun in this module. I learned a lot of new things like mainly 3D-printing and laser-cutting and also gained a lot of experince in those two manufacturing preocesses through the exercise project.\nIn the fields electrical engineering, microcontrollers and mechanics, I already had a lot of knowledge beforehand but still learned some new things that were pretty interesting.\nI think it would be pretty good to learn about the differnt manufacturing processes like 3D-printing and laser cutting a little earlier in the semester. That way it would be possible to start working on the exercise project earlier because for my project 3D-printing and laser-cutting needed the most time and intersected a little with my exam phase.\nProgress over the semester # In the beginning of the Semester we had to make a presentation about a DIY project which we thought would be interesting.\nI took a project from Stuff Made Here:\nI wrote the following about, if I could do the project:\nI think after this semester I definitely gained a lot of experience so that this project is even easier to implement.\nNow I know how to use a 3D-printer, so the manufacturing process should be a lot easier then before the semester. My exercise project didn\u0026rsquo;t involved a lot of programming so that still would be a challenge but I also communicated with a apple device so there is a little progress as well.\nNext semester # I am really looking forward to the next semester and working on a bigger project with also a lot more time for it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t really know yet what my project for the second semester will be but I think an autonomous driving car, or a app with which I can controll all the lights of my lego models would be interesting to make. Another cool project would be to motorise the manual function of height adjusting my desk which would be controlled via wifi over a website to safe different prefered heights, etc.\n","date":"28 February 2023","permalink":"/swh/posts/exercise-project/","section":"Posts","summary":"Presentation # We had a small fair to present our projects.

GCode basically is the model sliced into a lot of layers which when printed ontop of each other build the model again.\nFused Deposition Modeling (FDM) # FDM-printing is the cheapest way of 3D printing and this more common used in a private environment. The quality and details of this type of printer is badder compared to other types of printers. It works heating up Filament and depositting it through a nozzle onto a print-bed.\nUltimaker 2+ (Left), Snapmaker original (right) Ultimaker 2+ printing Finished print on the snapmaker original Stereolithography (SLA) and Digital Light Procressing (DLP) # SLA-printing uses a laser and a specific liquid (resin) to create 3D-structures. The Laser hits and because of that hardens the liquid only on the spots where a structure is supposed to be. This gets repeated layer for layer.\nDLP-printing works similary to SLA-printing.\nSelective Laser Sintering (SLS) # For SLS-printing a powder is used which then gets hardend by a laser. It has pretty good mechanical properties and because of the powder no support structures for overhangs are needed. Unfortunately it only available for industry.\nSelective Powder Deposition (SPD) # SPD-printing works similary to SLS-printing, its also possible to print metals. Currently not very common.\nCAD- vs. mesh-software # Mesh-software should only be used to create 3D-models for organic sturctures like figurines because it does not offer the best dimensional accuracy. With CAD-software on the other hand it is possible to create accurately measured 3D-models which is usefull if you need parts specifically sized.\nLab # In the MI-Lab we have the following devices avilable:\nCreality CR10 S5 with a 500 mm x 500 mm print-bed ELEGOO MARS 2 Pro which is a SLA-printer Snapmaker Original which is capable of printing, cnc-milling as well as laser engraving Ultimaker Original and Ultimaker 2+ For slicing Ultimaker Original, Ultimaker 2+ as well as Creality CR10 S5 need Cura. The printer Snapmaker Original needs Snapmaker Luban for slicing and ELEGOO MARS 2 Pro needs Chitubox.\nWhen creating 3D-models there is a variety of software available, for example Solidworks and Sketchup which are used by a lot of people, I personally really like to use Autodesk Fusion 360. If you want to create more natural and shapes like figuriens Blender is a popular option to use.\nProblems while printing: # When printing a lot of problems can occur, I personally experienced a clogged nozzle, warping and bad overhangs.\nMy print with bad overhang in the hole My print in which you can see that the nozzle was clogged while printing the bottom part.

We got an introduction into CNC mill bits and learned about problems you have to face with a CNC mill for exampel that it is impossible to make really small sharp inner corners because a mill bit is always round and that the thinness of a wall is limited due to vibration during milling.\nAfter CNC milling we got an introduction to laser cutting and the laser cutter we have in our lab. With a laser-cutter it is possible to cut, engrave as well as mark material. When cutting like it is when sawing wood, material gets removed, which has to be calculated when creating a sketch you want to cut. When designing its usefull tu creat interlocking parts in order to make the final object more stable, its also possible to design bending structures for some really interesting shapes.\nSource: https://www.instructables.com/Curved-laser-bent-wood/\nLastly we learned about safety when working with laser-cutters as well as CNC-mills.\nFor laser-cutters it is important to only use materials which you can find in the manual of the cutter (in our case Emblaser 2). All other materials should not be used to be cut by the laser-cutter especially if you are not sure which material you have infornt of you.\nLab # In the Lab part we then made our first-hand experiences with laser cutting.\nSketching # First we had to sketch our project and parts of it we could potentially cut/make with a laser-cutter.\nSketch 1\nMy plan is to build a rc-car, and the body of it I want to build out of laser-cutted pieces. The car is inspired by a Landrover Defender.\nThe the sketch in the top left corner consists of two pieces which overlapp in order to better glue them together.\nIn the bottom right corner you can see the same two pieces as in the top left corner with a system to connect them even more stable together.\nSketch 2\nHere you can see the second part of my sketch which includes the chassis of my car with some tries on the steering system, everything you can see here has to be 3D-printed.\nCreating a svg # After sketching we went to a tool of our choice, in my case Affinity Designer and designed a small maximum 5x5cm svg to cut with the laser cutter.\nI choosed the top siede-part of my car-body with the windows:\nThe two notches on the bottom are there to connect the part more secure and a test on how thick I have to make a notch in order to interlock it with other parts. The thickness of the material is 3 mm, I went with a notch 2,8 mm wide which worked out perfectly in the end.\nLaser Cutting and Final Part # The final svg then can be loaded into LightBurn.\nIt is important to choose which cuts have to be made first, in my case the windows, because if you cut the outer edge first the whole part would be loose and could slip while cutting the windows. The reason for this is that there is a ventilation system in the Laser-Cutter which vibrates a little.\nHere you can see the cutted piece slotted into the two inner window pieces.\nIn LighBurn its also important to choose the settings for cutting a certain material.\nIn this case we used the preset for our material and modivied it so that the laser makes 3 rounds and also moves down around 1 mm after each round of cutting.\n","date":"28 January 2023","permalink":"/swh/posts/subtractive-manufacturing/","section":"Posts","summary":"In the lecture part of subtractive manufacturing we first learned about vector graphics as well as G-Code which is used in a lot of computer guided machines like laser cutters, 3D-printers, etc.","title":"Subtractive Manufacturing"},{"content":"In the lecture part of mechanics we learnd a little bit about the physical basics and some important formulas regarding them.

Hall-Sensor without magnet (LED1 is turned on), LDR-Sensor covered (LED2 is turned on) Week 2: Wifi, Servo-Motor controlled via the Blynk-App # First I turned on and off a LED over WIFI with a D1 Mini and after that I tried the Blynk App to control a servo over my phone, you can see the code below.\nCode:\n#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID \u0026#34;xxx\u0026#34; #define BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME \u0026#34;xxx\u0026#34; #define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN \u0026#34;xxx\u0026#34; #define BLYNK_PRINT Serial #include \u0026lt;ESP8266WiFi.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;Servo.h\u0026gt; Servo servo1; char auth[] = BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN; // Your WiFi credentials. // Set password to \u0026#34;\u0026#34; for open networks. char ssid[] = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; char pass[] = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; BlynkTimer timer; // This function is called every time the Virtual Pin 0 state changes BLYNK_WRITE(V0) { // Set incoming value from pin V0 to a variable int value = param.asInt(); Serial.println(value); if (value == 1) { servo1.write(-90); } else { servo1.write(90); } // Update state Blynk.virtualWrite(V1, value); } // This function is called every time the device is connected to the Blynk.Cloud BLYNK_CONNECTED() { // Change Web Link Button message to \u0026#34;Congratulations!\u0026#34; Blynk.setProperty(V3, \u0026#34;offImageUrl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://static-image.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/general/fte/congratulations.png\u0026#34;); Blynk.setProperty(V3, \u0026#34;onImageUrl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://static-image.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/general/fte/congratulations_pressed.png\u0026#34;); Blynk.setProperty(V3, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/what-do-i-need-to-blynk/how-quickstart-device-was-made\u0026#34;); } // This function sends Arduino\u0026#39;s uptime every second to Virtual Pin 2. void myTimerEvent() { // You can send any value at any time. // Please don\u0026#39;t send more that 10 values per second. Blynk.virtualWrite(V2, millis() / 1000); } void setup() { // Debug console servo1.attach(D6); Serial.begin(9600); Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass); // You can also specify server: //Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass, \u0026#34;blynk.cloud\u0026#34;, 80); //Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass, IPAddress(192,168,1,100), 8080); // Setup a function to be called every second timer.setInterval(1000L, myTimerEvent); } void loop() { Blynk.run(); timer.run(); // You can inject your own code or combine it with other sketches. // Check other examples on how to communicate with Blynk. Remember // to avoid delay() function! } Here you can see the circuit:\nWeek 3: External Interrupt # In this week I tried external Interrupts, they are helpfull to monitor (user-)input and react to them. The Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is a callback function with 4 modes:\nLow: Interrupt is triggered if pin is low Change: Interrupt is triggered if pin state changes Rising: Interrupt is triggered if pin switches from low to high Falling: Interrupt is triggered if pin switches from high to low High: Interrupt is triggered if pin is high My idea of using external interrupts was to have two LEDs, of whom one is green and shows that everything works OK and the other one is red and starts blinking if there is a problem. In my case the \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; gets triggered by a button, after which the green LED turns of and the red one start blinking. If the button gets pressed again the problem is \u0026ldquo;solved\u0026rdquo;, the red LED truns off and the green one is on again.\nHere you can see the code, I used the \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo;- mode for the ISR:\nconst int ledPin1 = 12; //Grüne LED const int ledPin2 = 11; //Rote LED const int buttonPin = 2; //Interrupt Button int x=0, y=0; //Variablen zum Hochzählen int ledToggle1 = HIGH; //Zustand Grüne LED int ledToggle2 = LOW; // Zustand Rote LED für Interrupt //Variablen um timing der Interrupts festzustellen unsigned long button_time = 0; unsigned long last_button_time = 0; int ledState = LOW; //Zustand Rote LED für Blinken //Variable zum Blinken der Roten LED unsigned long previousMillis = 0; const long interval = 250; //Blink delay der Roten LED void button_ISR(){ button_time = millis(); //check to see if increment() was called in the last 250 milliseconds if (button_time - last_button_time \u0026gt; 250){ Serial.print(\u0026#34;Interrupt \u0026#34;); Serial.print(y++); Serial.println(); ledToggle1 = !ledToggle1; digitalWrite(ledPin1, ledToggle1); ledToggle2 = !ledToggle2; digitalWrite(ledPin2, ledToggle2); last_button_time = button_time; } } void setup() { pinMode(ledPin1, OUTPUT); pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT); pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); Serial.begin(9600); attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(buttonPin), button_ISR, CHANGE); digitalWrite(ledPin1, HIGH); } void loop(){ Serial.print(\u0026#34;loop \u0026#34; ); Serial.print(x++ ); Serial.println(); unsigned long currentMillis = millis(); if (y%2==1){ if (currentMillis - previousMillis \u0026gt;= interval) { // save the last time you blinked the LED previousMillis = currentMillis; // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa: if (ledState == LOW) { ledState = HIGH; } else { ledState = LOW; } // set the LED with the ledState of the variable: digitalWrite(ledPin2, ledState); } } } Circuit:\nHere you can see everything in action:\n","date":"6 December 2022","permalink":"/swh/posts/microcontroller/","section":"Posts","summary":"In the lecture parts of microcontrollers we got introduced to the Arduino-Ecosystem of boards and shields.
